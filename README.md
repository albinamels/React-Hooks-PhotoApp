## Welcome to my [photo finder](https://albina-photos.netlify.app/) app:) 

This is an app to search photos created in React with Pagination and Debounce features. 
- Pagination optimizes site performance by loading smaller data chunks, leading to faster page loading times and smoother navigation. 
- Debouncing prevents frequent, time-consuming data fetching calls, enhancing overall user experience.
